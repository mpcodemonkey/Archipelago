# Dark Souls II Archipelago

Dark Souls II client and world implementations for the [Archipelago multiworld randomizer](https://archipelago.gg/). Currently supports both the vanilla and Scholar of the First Sin versions of the game.

## How to Use

### Installing the mod

The mod works with a single `dinput8.dll` file.

- Download the dll and apworld files from the [latest release](https://github.com/WildBunnie/DarkSoulsII-Archipelago/releases) for your game version.
- Rename the dll file to `dinput8.dll`.
- Place the `dinput8.dll` file inside the `Game` folder in the game folder, next to the executable.
- If playing on Linux, add `WINEDLLOVERRIDES="dinput8.dll=n,b" %command%` to the game's launch options on Steam.

### Generating the world

- Download the latest version of the Archipelago client available [here](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases/latest).
- Inside the Archipelago client, press `Install APWorld` and select the apworld you downloaded.
- Press `Generate Template Options` and grab the `Dark Souls II.yaml`.
- Edit the settings on the yaml file to your liking, especially changing your name and selecting the version of the game you will be playing.
- Press `Browse Files` in the client and place your yaml file and any others from people you might be playing with inside the `Players` folder.
- Press `generate` in the client to generate the world.
- Now either choose `host` to host the game locally or upload the file in the `output` folder to [Archipelago's website](https://archipelago.gg/uploads).

### Joining a game

- (Optional) Backup your save just to make sure the mod doesn't mess with it.
- Simply launch the game and a console will launch together with it.
- In that console type `/connect server_address:port slot_name password`, replacing the correct values. The password is optional and the slot name is the name you placed in the yaml file.
- For example, if you host on Archipelago's website it would look something like `/connect archipelago.gg:123456 JohnSouls`.
- Start a new game and enjoy.

## Building Locally

- clone the repository
- run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to download the submodules
- make sure you have vcpkg, it should be installed together with Visual Studio, and then run `vcpkg integrate install`
- set the correct platform (x86 for vanilla, x64 for Scholar) and build

## Frequently Asked Questions

### **Do I need to play in offline mode? Is it safe to play online?**
The mod forces the game to start in offline mode. We do not offer a version of the mod that works online. If you have a firewall rule to block Dark Souls II it will make the mod unable to communicate with Archipelago (unless it's hosted locally) so you will have to deactivate that rule to play the mod.

### **I get `Access is denied` when trying to connect to Archipelago.**
This happens if you have a rule in your firewall blocking Dark Souls II like mentioned above.

### The game crashes when joining a server.
This can happen for multiple reasons:
  - Verify that you are on the latest version of the game, anything but the latest Steam version is unsupported.
